## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js

## Scripts

Run project locally on your machine.

```bash
npm start # or
docker compose up
```

Run all e2e tests. In order for this to work locally, you need to change the [Node version](/Dockerfile#1) from the RedHat to `node:latest` for example. Then run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

Run e2e tests in interactive Cypress environment. In order for this to work correctly change the baseURL in the [cypress.config](cypress.config.js#8) to `localhost:3000`. Then you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run test:cypress
```

Run static code analysis tools. Each commit triggers these runs through the pre-commit hooks.

```bash
npm run lint # Run eslint
npm run format # Run prettier
```

## Development

To use production data for development run

```bash
./scripts/get_prod_db.sh
```

Typescript? `as unknown as ...` and `: any` are allowed.

## Environment configuration

Get the JAMI api key from Openshift JAMI pod. Use version.helsinki.fi documentation for that.

Get the OPENAI api key from someone developing currently.
